I got my master's degree from Harvard University, advised by [Professor Molin Wang](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/molin-wang/). I got my bachelor's degree from Peking University, with a dissertation advised by [Professor Tao Xue](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/info/1671/4758.htm).

My research focuses on developling statistical methods in modern causal inference and applied the tools to real-world health studies. My current theoretical work is to understand structural nested models in target trial emulation. My applied work involves research in cancer, environmental health, and hearing loss.
